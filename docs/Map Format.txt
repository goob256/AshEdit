This documents describes the file format of AshEdit maps.

Everything in the maps is little-endian, which means for multi-byte numbers,
the least significant byte comes first.

Listed below is the data in the maps in order it comes in the file.

--

1) 4 byte id which is always "ASH!"

2) 16 bit level width (in tiles)

3) 16 bit level height (in tiles)

4) 1 byte number of layers

5) width * height bytes walkable flag. 0 means walkable, anything else is solid.

6) for each layer
	for each row
		for each column
			1 byte flags:
				- 1st (lowest) bit tells if the square is
				  occupied or not. If this bit is 0, there was
				  no tile placed on this square and the next 3
				  bytes (below) are skipped
			if flag bit 1 is non-zero:
				- 1 byte x position of tile in tilemap
				- 1 byte y position of tile in tilemap
				- 1 byte tile sheet number

These areas theoretically support 65536x65536 tile maps with maximum sheet size
of 256x256 tiles (tiles can be any size,) however the application limits maps to
256x256 because maps larger than that use an enormous amount of memory.
